# Hyrule Compendium API

This project is a recreation of the Hyrule Compendium from *The Legend of Zelda* series, built for **DESN 468 Web Design 3**. It fulfills the assignment requirements by:

- Sourcing and displaying API-based content
- Using semantic HTML structure with `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` to group images and descriptions
- Building the project with the **Astro framework**, incorporating components and layout refactoring
- Dynamically rendering creature data using JSON without hardcoding
- Styling the layout with **CSS Flexbox and Grid modules** to create a responsive, gallery-style interface

---

I chose this API because I love Zelda, and this particular one has many categories, as well as images and item descriptions to display on the cards.
